Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `dev`.
2. **If you've added code** that should be tested, add tests.
3. **If youâ€™ve modified any modules or files**, update the documentation accordingly.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5. **Make sure your code lints** using `ms-python.autopep8` from VSCode.
6. **Issue that pull request**!

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Style Guide

- Use The Black code style.
- Use `ms-python.black-formatter` from VSCode for formatting.

### Clean Code and Documentation

- Write clean and understandable code.
- If the code is self-explanatory and makes sense to both you and the reviewer, no additional documentation is needed.
- If the code is complex or not immediately clear, provide documentation to explain it.
