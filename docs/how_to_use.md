# HOW TO USE

## Basics

### Soundwave Drawing

You can draw the Shape of the Soundwave inside the big Plot.
The Dots are the individual points of the Line you draw.

You can select them in the Select Box labeled **Predefined Functions**

> This is one of the predefined functions, its called **nice**, cause i find it sounds nice and i had no better name, if you have a
> problem with this, find a better name!

## Training

Once you have drawn the Shape of the Soundwave you Start the trainings Process by Clicking on the **Start Training** Button.

The Trainings Process gets initialized and after some time a Red Line appears in the Plot, this it the current output of the model.
