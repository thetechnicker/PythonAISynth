# My Idea about this programm

I want to create a Python-Application where you draw a function and a neural-net tries to aproximate it to make sound from it.


## GUI Desing

My idea is that you have a Canvas containing the graph you can draw and any time you change it the neural net gets updated. there should also be a way to play some notes. I also want some Controll dials like Volume, base frequenzy, or something like an Equalizer.


## Backend

i want to use a simple neural net getting trained to aproximate a drawn function. the app also has a midi input and a audio output.

### Training Data

the data is generated by spliting the draing in the canvas to single points.

The amount of samples in the training data should be able to be way lower than the sample rate at the end, this could be either archive via this:
$newpoint=\frac{(old\_point_1+old\_point_2)}{2}$ or by duplicating points and adding a random small amount to $x$ and $y$ of the new point.
