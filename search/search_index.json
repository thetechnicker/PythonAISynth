This could result in cleaner sounds, as MIDI notes correspond to specific frequencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modulation: I plan to create interesting effects by modulating my sound with other signals. For example, I could use a low-frequency oscillator (LFO) to modulate the amplitude, frequency, or phase of my sound, creating effects like tremolo, vibrato, or phasing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Effects Processing: I'm considering adding audio effects like reverb, delay, distortion, or chorus to enhance the sound of my synth. I would implement these effects using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p>Envelope Shaping: To give me more control over the temporal evolution of my sound and make it more expressive, I'm planning to implement an ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I'm excited about these enhancements and looking forward to implementing them in my project!</p>"}]}
